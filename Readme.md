## 🚀 What's This?

**FrontEndExplorer** is my digital notebook, sketchpad, and sandbox — all in one!  
This repo holds a bunch of frontend experiments I built while learning things like:

- ✨ HTML5 (the bones)
- 🎨 CSS / SCSS / Tailwind (the styling wizards)
- 🧠 JavaScript / TypeScript (the logic & type guards)
- ⚛️ React (the component universe)
- 🌐 Next.js (for full-stack-ish frontend fun)
- 🧪 Testing (because bugs don’t fix themselves)
- 🎭 UI/UX experiments (where form meets feel)

## 💡 Why I Made This

Because:

* I break things 💥
* Then I fix them 🛠️
* And sometimes, it actually works! 🎉

Also: to track my progress, share what I build, and maybe help someone else along the way.


## 🔮 Future Experiments (aka coming soon-ish...)

* [ ] A11y basics (accessibility!)
* [ ] Dark/light mode toggle 🌗
* [ ] Fetching APIs without crying 😅
* [ ] Animations with zero regrets 🌀
