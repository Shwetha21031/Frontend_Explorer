# 📌 Project Title: *Image slider*

## project description
Endless vibes, zero clicks needed! 🎉
I had an absolute blast building this super smooth image slider! It’s an infinite loop of awesomeness — slides just keep rolling every 5 seconds like clockwork. No need to lift a finger (but hey, you can click “next” or “prev” if you're feeling adventurous 😄). Each slide glides in with slick animations — and yes, even the text joins the party with its own flair. It's like a mini slideshow concert and I loved every second of creating it! 💃🖼️✨
